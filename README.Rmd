The goal of this package is to reproduce the paper “Metapopulation persistence can be inferred from incomplete surveys” by Chuliang Song, Marie-Josée Fortin, and Andrew Gonzalez.


## Installation

You can install the development version of ReproduceMetaCap from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("clsong/ReproduceMetaCap")
```

## Reproduce
The main figures can be reproduced simply by running *plot_figure_Number*. For example, figure 3 can be reproduced as
```{r dpi=300, warning=F, message=F}
library(ReproduceChickenEgg)
plot_figure_3()
```
